# Feedreader Jasmine Testing

This project is part of the Udacity Front-end Nano-Degree. The purpose of this project is to learn test-driven development.

## Tests Implemented

The project provided required four tests suites to be populated by the student. In addition to the four required test suites, this student implemented one additional test. 

The additional test verifies the existence of a 'feed-count-header' element and that this element has an innerText value equal to the number entries for the selected feed.
